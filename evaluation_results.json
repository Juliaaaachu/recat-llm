    "feedback": "The prompt aligns well with the 'Words of Affirmation' love language by encouraging partners to reflect on meaningful verbal interactions. It promotes emotional engagement through recalling personal moments of feeling valued or loved. The level of specificity is high as it asks for specific instances, which encourages deeper reflection. The prompt is actionable, though it could be slightly clearer in terms of guiding users on how to express their gratitude after reflection. It fits reasonably well with the app's context but could better integrate the pet-caring or gamification aspect to make it more engaging within the app's unique framework. The tone is warm and encourages introspection, fitting well with the app's supportive and friendly nature.\n\nSuggestions: Add an element that ties back to the virtual pet or game aspect, such as suggesting that expressing this gratitude could 'earn a reward for your pet.' Also, offer examples of how one might express appreciation, such as crafting a note or planning a surprise, to enhance actionability."

    "feedback": "The prompt is closely aligned with the love language of Words of Affirmation, as it encourages the user to reflect on specific verbal expressions that were meaningful to them. It is emotionally engaging, prompting the user to think deeply about how their partner's words made them feel. The specificity and depth are strong because it pushes the user to recall specific instances and the emotional impact of those moments. Actionability is relatively high, as the prompt directs users clearly to think about a recent event and their feelings. However, the fit within the context of a gamified pet-caring app is somewhat limited. The tone is warm and encouraging, maintaining the feel of a friendly guide.\n\nSuggestions: To improve app context fit, consider incorporating an element that ties back to the shared activity of caring for the pet. For example, users might reflect on how their partner's encouraging words inspired them to be a better pet caregiver. Additionally, slightly simplifying the language could make the prompt more accessible and enhance actionability."

The emotional engagement is strong as it asks users to consider the impact of their partner's words, fostering a warm and personal connection. The prompt is actionable, providing clear guidance on what to do: thank the partner and share how it made the user feel. Its fit within the app's context is good but not perfect, as it doesn't directly incorporate the gamified or pet-care aspects. The tone is appropriately warm and supportive.\n\nSuggestions: To enhance app context fit, consider integrating the virtual pet as part of the gratitude sharing, such as suggesting the user could tell their partner how their words also made the pet feel joyful or helped in a playful way. Additionally, adding a playful twist or challenge could align better with the app's gamified nature."
